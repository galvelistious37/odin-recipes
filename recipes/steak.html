        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 New York Strip Steaks, each 1 pound and 1 1/4" thick</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>Rosemary</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Pat dry</strong> – use paper towels to pat the steaks dry to get a perfect <br>
                sear and reduce oil splatter.</li>
            <li><strong>Season generously</strong> – just before cooking steaks, sprinkle both sides  <br>
                liberally with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li><strong>Preheat the pan</strong> on medium and brush with oil. Using just 1/2 Tbsp oil  <br>
                reduces splatter.</li>
            <li><strong>Sear steaks</strong> – add steaks and sear each side 3-4 minutes until a brown  <br>
                crust has formed then use tongs to turn steaks on their sides and sear edges (1 min per edge).</li>
            <li><strong>Add butter and aromatics</strong> – melt in butter with quartered garlic cloves  <br>
                and rosemary sprigs. Tilt pan to spoon garlic butter over steaks and cook  <br>
                to your desired doneness.</li>
            <li><strong>Remove steak</strong> and rest 10 minutes before slicing against the grain.</li>
        </ol>
